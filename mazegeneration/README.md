# Maze Generation Project
## Description
This project is created by 3 TU Berlin student (Sebastianus Dustin Susanto, Gregorius Kevin Soetanto, Georgius Kenneth Liauwangsa) at the end of the module named "Computer Orinetierte Mathematik". The aim of this project is to create a maze generator that has its starting point and end point randomly generated within the maze and solve it immediately after the generation of the maze. The programming language that is used here is Julia.
